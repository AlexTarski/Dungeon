# Dungeon

This project presents the workings of Bfs algorithm and
uses it to find the best route through the dungeon.

The best way means (1) the shortest way
(2) with the most valuable chest lying on that way.

If it is impossible to reach any chest and exit the dungeon with it,
the best way equals the route from start to exit.
